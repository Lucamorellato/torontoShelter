      <p>Housing and Shelter demand is a major issue in Toronto. This is a simple way to present all of the data we have on the privately and publicly shelters within the City of Toronto and their respective availability.</p>
      <p>All of the data here is provided by the <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/" target="_blank">Open Data Project</a> by the City of Toronto. Numbers are updated every two days. If you need access to a Shelter please go to: <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/community-people/housing-shelter/" target="_blank"> Housing & Shelter</a></p>
